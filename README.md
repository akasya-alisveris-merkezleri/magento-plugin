# Tazapay Payments Plugin for Magento

This plugin enables your Magento powered platform to start accepting international payments via Tazapay's Escrow product.

### How do Tazapay's escrow payments work?
1. The buyer can select the product or service and make a payment like any other online checkout option (available payment methods depend on the buyer's country and the amount of money to be transferred)
2. Once the payment is complete, the funds are received and secured in a bank account under the jurisdiction of MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore)
3. Once the product is shipped or the services rendered, the seller (or your platform) can provide a proof of order fulfillment to Tazapay for verification
4. As soon as Tazapay verifies the documents, the payment is released to the seller

### Features
1. Add an international payment method to your checkout page to enable payments from buyers from over 90+ countries
2. Low cost secured payments for buyers and sellers at best in class FX rates
3. Easily monetize your platform by enabling a platform fee: we handle the collection and settlement on your behalf!
4. Wide variety of payment methods accepted: Mastercard, VISA, Local Bank Transfers, and other local payment
5. Especially relevant for B2B as large value transactions upto $1M are supported at a low cost and with escrow protection. Fully compliant with local and international regulations, all relevant trade documents are provided.
